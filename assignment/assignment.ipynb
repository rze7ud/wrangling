        "**Answers:**\n",
        "1. **This paper is about data tidying: a method of cleaning data with a specific structure that makes it more easy/efficient to model and visualize**\n",
        "2. **The tidy data standard intends to provide a framework that simplifies intitial data cleaning process, therefore facilitating a focus on the analysis rather than the logistics of the data**\n",
        "3. **The first sentence explains that when a dataset is tidy, it usually is very similar to other tidy datasets and easy to manipulate. On the other hand, if a dataset is messy, it likely has its own unique intricacies that can be much more difficult to handle case by case. The second sentence explains that the process of interpreting the meaning behind the name of a variable is hard to find on its own without further explanation of what it is being used for.**\n",
        "4. **Values: Numbers (quantitative) or strings (qualitative). Variables: Contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units. Obervations: Contains all values measured on the same unit across attributes.**\n",
        "5. **Tidy Data: standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure: Each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row and each type of observational unit forms a table.**\n",
        "6. **The five most common problems with messy datasets are: Column headers are values instead of variable names, multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of obervational units are stored in the same table and a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The data in Table 4 is messy because both religion and income are variables and therefore should be columns. Melting a dataset means that you stack columns into new rows, making the dataset taller.**\n",
        "7. **Table 11 is messy because it separates the days of the months into separate columns. Table 12 is molten because it combines the columns year, month and days into one variable: date.**\n",
        "8. **The chicken-and-egg problem of tidy data occurs since tidy tools are created to be used on tidy datasets. This means that tidy data has a potential to be a false start and many tools will have to be redeveloped for a future method of cleaning data. Wickham hopes that there could be more emphasis on studies that can be done on tasks during the process of data cleaning.**\n",
